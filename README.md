#### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Shawn a Tech Lead at Hagerty. Prior to that I was a Senior Software Developer at the Denver Regional Council of Governments. I specialize in Full-stack JavaScript/TypeScript (React, Next.js, and Node) and data visualization. I have a working knowledge of AWS, Serverless, D3.js, Python, PHP, Go, Redux, GraphQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, DynamoDB, and Docker. Feel free to reach out and say hey!
